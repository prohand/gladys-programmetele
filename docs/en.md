# Programme Télé (French TV guide)

This integration shows the TV guide of the French TNT channels in Gladys:
what is on **now**, what comes **next** and what is on **tonight**.

## What you get

One device per selected channel (for example "Programme TV TF1"), with 3
text sensors:

- **En cours** (now) — the programme on air, with its times
  (`JT 20h (20:00 - 20:45)`);
- **À suivre** (next) — the next programme (`20:45 · Petits plats en équilibre`);
- **Ce soir** (tonight) — the programme on air at 21:10, Paris time
  (`21:10 · Koh-Lanta`).

Times are always displayed in the Paris time zone.

## Configuration

1. Open the **Configuration** tab of the integration.
2. Tick the **channels** to follow (30 TNT channels available).
3. Save: the devices show up in the **Discovery** tab, ready to be added.

The sensors are updated every minute. The full guide (8 days) is downloaded
at most every 6 hours.

## Dashboard widget

Add the **TV guide** widget to a dashboard (Gladys 5.1 or later). Settings:

- **Show**: _Now_ (with the time left) or _Tonight (21:10)_;
- **Channels**: up to 8 channels; leave empty to use the channels of the
  integration configuration.

Tap a row to read the programme summary. The widget refreshes itself when a
programme ends.

## Scenes

**Trigger "A TV programme starts"** — starts a scene when a programme
begins. Filters (empty = any):

- **Channels**: one or more channels;
- **Exact title**: e.g. `Koh-Lanta` (exact match, case included; "contains"
  is not possible).

Variables for the following actions: channel, title, sub-title, category,
start time, end time, duration (min). Example: "When Koh-Lanta starts on
TF1, turn on the TV and send me a message".

The trigger works for all 30 channels, even the ones not ticked in the
configuration. A programme is detected within seconds of its start. After an
outage, the programmes started in the last 5 minutes still trigger the scene;
older ones do not.

**Action "Get the TV programme of a channel"** — returns to the scene what
is on now, next and tonight (full text, title only, time). Example: send
every evening at 20:00 "Tonight on France 2: …".

## Actions

- **Test the TV guide** — downloads the guide right now and shows what is on
  the first selected channel. If the download fails, it says so, and whether
  the previous guide is still used.

## Data source

The guide comes from the free XMLTV feed of [xmltvfr.fr](https://xmltvfr.fr)
(TNT file). No account, no API key. The integration needs Internet access.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Aucun programme"**: the source has no data for this channel at that time.
- **"Disconnected" status**: the message says what is wrong.
  - _Cannot download the TV guide_: no guide could be downloaded yet; a new
    try is made every 2 minutes.
  - _The TV guide is out of date_: the source has been down for a long time
    and the old guide in memory has nothing left to come.
  - _Gladys refused the TV channel devices_ or _Cannot send the programmes to
    Gladys_: the guide is there, Gladys refused it; the integration tries
    again on its own every minute.
- If a download fails while an older guide is in memory, that one keeps being
  used (it covers several days); a new try is made 15 minutes later. The
  **Test the TV guide** button says so too.
- Check the integration logs from the Gladys UI (or `docker logs` on the
  host) with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for the full details.
